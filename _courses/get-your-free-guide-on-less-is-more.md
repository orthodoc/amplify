### 7 part guide to Less is More


The number one frustration among doctors is -- Long working hours!

That is the sad state of affairs in healthcare. As an industry, we seem to have forgotten that we are human beings and not machines.

For a world that is so focused on work, it has become a norm to be busy. *Being busy* is a badge of honor that we all proudly wear at the hospital. And at times we take it along to our homes as well. Sadly enough, it is this badge of honor that is the number one cause of frustration. We are mired in this illusion that we can *work* our way out of this.

Hold there for a minute! Ask yourself this honest question -- Can I work more than what my body can take?

The answer to that question is obvious. It is a loud and clear NO! Then why do we constantly do this? Why do we constantly beat ourselves? It is because we are fed this as soon as we enter medical school. Doctors are no ordinary beings. They are more clever and better equipped to handle stress. They are super beings. And our teachers did this for they feared we would buckle under pressure. Their idea was to make us mentally strong. Unfortunately that strategy is not working any more, for we are stretching it too far.

[Dr Roshan](https://goo.gl/p7wlvU) anguished over the dismal state of doctors in his post -- [*Why I won't allow my daughter to become a doctor?*](https://goo.gl/jEUT4K) That post went viral with more than 400000 views. Sadly, this is a universal phenomenon. [Sandeep Jauhar](https://goo.gl/RZsZ7I), an attending cardiologist has chronicled this and other issues ailing doctors in his book --- [Doctored](http://amzn.to/2fLiocH). There are plenty more on this -- [The Atlantic](https://goo.gl/G2YgzA) article, [WSJ article](https://goo.gl/Ps1sS9), write-up at [KevinMD](https://goo.gl/onuqFb) and [The Times](https://goo.gl/LEZESL) article.

The good news is, you are not alone on this one. To solve any problem, the number one step is to acknowledge it. That is what all those articles do. We have a case of the disillusioned doctor. You're right! To a great extent the fault lies in the system. Systemic issues need to be sorted out, but they take time and effort. *The right attitude would be to learn how to scale the wall than bang your head against it.* System issues are not in our control. What you can control is *your life*! You can bring about changes in your routine that help you endure this strenuos system.

That is where I come into the picture. I was like this once upon a time. Rush to work at 7 in the morning and return home at 9 in the night, totally worn out and devoid of all energy. I continued doing this believing I was a *Super Doctor*. Until I made conscious efforts to shake myself out of it. Now I am a [Hip Replacement Surgeon](https://goo.gl/EL8bqN), an [app developer](https://goo.gl/f5gbmt), [entrepreneur](https://goo.gl/AP42sz), an ultra marathoner and an aspiring writer. I could do all this and am itching to do more everyday because I freed myself from that badge of honor. I carved out time for myself.

So don't flog yourself anymore. Beat the system. And come out strong. That is what I want for you. And this email course will be a guide for you to get there.
